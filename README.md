Why this is my proudest achievement?

In that 2 weeks, I spent about 6-8 days (4pm-12am) working on it. In the process of developing this system, I had to research to fully understand the MVC Architecture, how sessions work, how Java Servlets work, how to write SQL statements... I had to spent hours to debug as well. Not just my own system but my group member's part too (despite individually marked). And because of these 2 weeks that I went through, I learnt so much and created something purely from my own self-research. And overall, scored me a full mark on the assignment.
